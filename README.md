Describe the interactions between the system and its environment independent from the implementation.
•	The user needs to open the application. 
•	The user needs to enter the city name and press the search button.

•	If the user entered the correct city name, the weather conditions will be displayed on the screen like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. 

# User case diagram 
User case are used analyse the software's requirements, there are 3 main components in user case diagram, the first one is functional requirement which is already mentioned above and they are displayed inside user cases. The second one is actors, in this case we have two actors which is the user and the app, they interact with each other or with the system. The last one is relationship which is between actors and user cases, they are represeted by dotted lines with straight arrows.
