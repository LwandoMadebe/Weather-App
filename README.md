# User case diagram 
User case are used analyse the software's requirements, there are 3 main components in user case diagram, the first one is functional requirement which is already mentioned above and they are displayed inside user cases. The second one is actors, in this case we have two actors which is the user and the app, they interact with each other or with the system. The last one is relationship which is between actors and user cases, they are represeted by dotted lines with straight arrows.
